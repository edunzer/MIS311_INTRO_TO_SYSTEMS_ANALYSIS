General Overview of Course

MIS 311 is an introductory course designed to get you familiar with the terms and concepts used in figuring out how to implement complex information systems that solve practical business problems. Armed with the information in this course, you will be well prepared for the follow on course: MIS 312. It turns out there are many ways to analyze and design complex business solutions. The book we chose for this course has a bias toward software development. I have have some of my own biases in how to approach system analysis that I will share along the way. This course defines important concepts and lays the foundation for analyzing information systems from the viewpoint of the user stakeholders. Where my ideas differ from the authors of the text, I will attempt to make my thinking clear. It is very important that you understand that I will not take away credit for your submissions and ideas as long as you defend your point of view showing your understanding of the ideas and concepts shown in the book and presented in my slides. 

 Prior Knowledge: There is no pre-requisite knowledge needed to take this course. While some exposure to working in a successful company would be beneficial, and some experience with databases would be helpful, they are in no way required. 
 Objectives: This course is driven by objectives. All assignments, tests and reading are designed to help you achieve measurable success in the stated course and module objectives
